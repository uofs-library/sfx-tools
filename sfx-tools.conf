# Global settings that affect multiple SFX-Tools scripts
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# DATA_DIR is the directory that contains the exported SFX data.
# Output from all the scripts will also be placed in this directory.
# The default DATA_DIR is the same directory in which the scripts live
#
DATA_DIR	= /work/SFX-Tools

#
# SFX_SERVER should be the URL for your SFX server, including the SFX
# instance name
#
SFX_SERVER	= http://sfx.domain.com:9003/instance

#
# DEBUG_LEVEL controls how verbose the scripts are.
#  0 = No output
#  1 = Minimal debugging output
#  2 = Verbose debugging output
#
DEBUG_LEVEL	= 0


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# sfx-tools.pl Settings
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# SFX_EXPORT controls how the SFX export file (which we assume is named
# sfx_data.txt) is obtained from the SFX server
#
#   GET    = Fetch the file from the SFX server using an HTTP GET request
#            (assumes the export process has been automated using the
#            included 'sfx-export.pl' script and that the exported file is
#            accessible from remote systems)
#
#   MANUAL = The SFX data file was produced by "hand" (using the web-based
#            SFX admin interface) and transfered into the DATA_DIR
#            directory on the server that this script runs on
#
SFX_EXPORT	= GET

#
# If EMAIL is set, and email will be sent to that address when the
# entire conversion process is complete.
#
# EMAIL	=	erm@domain.com

#
# If the DATA_DIR is web accessible, you can set DOWNLOAD_URL to the
# full URL path for that directory.  This is useful in cases where
# you would like files such as the ERM import available via the web
# (to download to your local machine for example).
#
# If you are using the email features and have set an EMAIL address
# above, the URL given below will be included in the email that is sent
#
# DOWNLOAD_URL = http://webserver.domain.com/download_dir

#  URL Resolver Options (sfx_resolve_urls.pl)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# TTL is the "Time To Live" for a resolved URL, in days.  After this period
# the resolved URL is considered "stale" and will be resolved again.
#
TTL		= 30

# MAX_LOOKUPS determines the maximum number of journal level URLs to lookup
# per execution of the script.  The default is to resolve a URL for ALL
# objects that are new, expired, or changed from the last time the script
# was executed.  If MAX_LOOKUPS is set, then the number of new, expired, and
# changed objects will be capped at that number.
#
# The default is 0 (all new, expired and changed objects will be processed)
#
MAX_LOOKUPS	= 0

#
# SLEEP_TIME is the time, in microseconds, to wait between requests to the
# SFX server.  The default value is 250000 (quarter of a second). A lower
# value will speed up URL resolution but will put more of a stress on your
# SFX server.
#
SLEEP_TIME	= 250000


# The IGNORE_ and EXPIRE_ options control how the specified object or
# target is treated during the resolution process.
#
# Targets, ISSNs or Objects specified with one of the IGNORE_ options will
# be skipped, and no journal level URL will be resolved.   For example,
# some of the Gale targets just don't return journal level URLs, so
# there is no point even requesting one from the API.
#
# Targets, ISSNs or Objects specified with one of the EXPIRE_ options will
# be considered "stale", even if they are not older than the TTL value
# specified above, and a new journal level URL will be resolved.  This is
# useful in instances where you know a vendor has changed their linking
# structure and you need to refresh the URLs before the TTL passes.
#
# Syntax is:
#
#    IGNORE_TARGET = Target Name | SFX Target ID
#    IGNORE_ISSN   = ISSN Number
#    IGNORE_OBJECT = SFX Object ID
#
#    EXPIRE_TARGET = Target Name | SFX Target ID
#    EXPIRE_ISSN   = ISSN Number
#    EXPIRE_OBJECT = SFX Object ID
#

# GaleGroup Business and Company Resource Center
IGNORE_TARGET =  111031861260000
# GaleGroup Health Reference Center Academic
IGNORE_TARGET =  111021039432000
# GaleGroup Literature Resource Center
IGNORE_TARGET =  111031861411000

#  SFX to ERM Conversion Options (sfx2erm.pl)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# ERM_INCLUDE_TYPE determines which set of SFX Object Types are included in
# the ERM output file.  This option can be one of JOURNAL, BOOK, or ALL.
# The default is JOURNAL.  The mapping of JOURNAL and BOOK to actual SFX 
# object types is the same as that outlined by the SFX explort.pl scxript:
#
#   JOURNAL = JOURNAL, SERIES, CONFERENCE, NEWSPAPER, TRANSCRIPT, WIRE
#   BOOK    = PROCEEDING, BOOK, DISSERTATION, DOCUMENT, MANUSCRIPT, REPORT,
#             CD, DATABASE
#   ALL     = All of the above
#
ERM_INCLUDE_TYPE	= JOURNAL

#
# If ALT_LOOKUP is set to YES (or TRUE) an additional field containing the
# SFX Object ID will appear in the ERM import file.
#
#ALT_LOOKUP = YES

#
# ENUMCAPTION1 and ENUMCAPTION2 define the labels used in the ERM
# input file for Volume and Issue.  The default values are "Volume" and
# "Issue", so these options only need to be specified if values other
# than these are desired.
#
#ENUMCAPTION1 = Volume
#ENUMCAPTION2 = Issue


# ERM EXCLUSION OPTIONS
#
# These options are similar to the IGNORE_ options above.  They prevent
# the specified targets or objects from appearing in the ERM input file.
# For example, if you didn't want the DOAJ journals to appear in ERM
# you could exclude them with either of the following 2 lines
#
#   ERM_EXCLUDE_TARGET = DOAJ Directory of Open Access Journals
#   ERM_EXCLUDE_TARGET = 111061245432000
#
# The syntax for these is:
#
#    ERM_EXCLUDE_TARGET = Target Name | SFX Target ID
#    ERM_EXCLUDE_ISSN   = ISSN Number
#    ERM_EXCLUDE_OBJECT = SFX Object ID
#

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Additional ERM input file handling options
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ERM_SPLIT controls whether or not the large ERM input file is split
# into smaller files.  Possible values are:
#
#      NONE     Do not split the ERM data file
#      TARGET   Produce one file per SFX target
#      RECORDS  Split into file containing ERM_SPLIT_LINES each
#
#ERM_SPLIT         = TARGET
#ERM_SPLIT_RECORDS = 5000

#
# ERM_COMPRESS determines whether or not the ERM input file(s) are
# compressed using the ZIP compression format.
#
# ERM_COMPRESS = Yes


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  SFX to EJDB Conversion Options (sfx2ejdb.pl)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# EJDB_INCLUDE_TYPE works the same way ERM_INCLUDE_TYPE does, except
# is determines which set of SFX Object Types are included in EJDB
# data file.  The EJDB data file contains a subset of fields that make
# is useful as an input file for an external-to-SFX A-Z list
#
# EJDB_INCLUDE_TYPE        = JOURNAL
